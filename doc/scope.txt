What I want from sucle:

- fun
- hackable
- performant

I want it to be like super mario world's YUMP, YUMP 1/2, and YUMP 2.

sucle fills no niche.
I build sucle to fit my own desire regardless of what anyone else thinks.
sucle is my little world.

Constraints:
- 1 Person hacking on it (Me)
- It necessarily needs to be simple.

If you want an editor, use emacs.
If you want a pretty infinite block game, use minecraft with cubic chunks with datapacks, RTX and python scripting.

- 3D
- fun
- exceedingly simple
- wildly scriptable: see YUMP, or dream/tapl, 

If you want a GUI, write a web form.

It should be:
fun, performant, scriptable, concise.
