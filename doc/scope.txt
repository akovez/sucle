- as concise as humanly possible, simple
- as scriptable and modifiable as possible
- Stock images ripped from the web


- NOT GOALS:
 - Performance:
  - Bit packing
  - Occlusion queries
 - Correctness
  - Mathematically pure collision detection
 - Realism
  - Phong shading
  - Photorealism
  - Physical realism
 - infinite in xyz directions
 - Octree: may make rendering loads of blocks faster, but complicated.
 - Multiplayer: supposedly makes the game much more complicated.

sucle was built for my imac 2009, so contains optimizations for reading from disk, occlusion queries
minisucle is devloped on my 16 GB 1060 gtx 6gb so is much simpler yet more performant.
